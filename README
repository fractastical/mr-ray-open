*Setting up Mr-Ray on your own server**

Mr-Ray should work pretty much out the box you just need to do a little configuration.

In config.py you will need to change the following variables:
*ROBOT_IDENT* This should be the appspot identifier for your application
*CONSUMER_KEY* This should be your oauth consumer key for wave
*CONSUMER_SECRET* This should be your oauth consumer secret for wave
